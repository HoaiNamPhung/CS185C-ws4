The means and variances of helpfulness values will significantly differ between different products and different customers. Some products/customers tend to be more popular and prolific, thus resulting in a much greater size and value of raw helpfulness values to work with. Others tend to be far and few inbetween, with some customers/products being very unpopular and only having one review and a minimal helpfulness value (in which case, mean and variance also doesn't really matter).
